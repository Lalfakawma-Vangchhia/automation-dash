        1.  **Hook:** Start with an engaging question or a bold statement to grab the reader's attention. Use a relevant emoji at the beginning of this line.
        2.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the brand and its main value proposition.
        3.  **Feature List:** Present 3-5 key features or benefits. Each feature must start on a new line with a '‚úÖ' emoji to create a checklist.
        4.  **Contact/Location Information:** List the business's location, phone number, email, or website. Each piece of information should start on a new line and be preceded by a relevant emoji (e.g., üìç for location, üìû for phone, üìß for email, üåê for website).
        5.  **Call to Action (CTA):** End with a strong, concluding sentence that encourages the user to take the next step.
        6.  **Hashtags:** Generate a block of 10-15 relevant, niche, and popular hashtags at the very end of the caption.
        7.  **Do not add header or footer at all, just the caption along with the information provided by the user**
        8. **Do not generate or infer missing data (e.g., do not fabricate emails or taglines).**
        9. **Strictly avoid phrases like '[info not provided]', '[not specified]', or similar. If something is not provided, skip it silently.**
        10. **Ensure the final caption reads smoothly, feels complete, and is based only on the user‚Äôs input. No blank fields or unnatural gaps.**
